This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project uses OpenAI GPT 3.5(https://openai.com/product) for generating commentary text and uses Eleven Labs to generate Audio (https://beta.elevenlabs.io/).

You will need to generate Authentication token for both of them to get started.

Once you are done generating the tokens, create .env.local file and add below tokens.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVEN_LABS_VOICE_ID=
```

Once done, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
